## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download and install the Jira Spotter Chrome extension from the [Chrome Web Store](#) (soon - in review - for now download and load as unpacked extension).
2. Click the extension icon in your browser to open the settings panel.
3. Configure your Jira authentication method (OAuth or access key with base URL).
4. Add `jira-taskid="JIRA ID HERE"` anywhere in your project's HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Open your platform where you've added `jira-taskid` attributes or comments.
2. Click on the Jira Spotter icon in your browser to open the side panel.
3. View the Jira tickets associated with the page directly in the panel.

### Examples:

#### HTML:

You can place the `jira-taskid` attribute anywhere in your HTML. For example:

```html
<!-- Link a Jira ticket to this section -->
<div jira-taskid="JIRA-1234">Feature Section</div>

<!-- Or even in a comment -->
<!-- jira-taskid="JIRA-5678" -->
```

#### JavaScript:

The `jira-taskid` can also be used within comments in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
// jira-taskid="JIRA-91011"
// This function implements the feature described in JIRA-91011
function exampleFeature() {
  console.log("Feature implemented");
}
```

#### CSS:

Use `jira-taskid` within CSS comments to link styles to Jira tickets:

```css
/* jira-taskid="JIRA-121314" */
.my-class {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

Wherever you place the `jira-taskid`, the associated Jira task will appear in the side panel when the extension is active.

### Smart Selection

To quickly link Jira tickets from existing content:

1. Select any text or element containing a Jira ticket reference
2. Right-click and choose "Link Jira Ticket"
3. You will be asked to pick from tickets found on the page or to enter a Jira URL/ID
4. A comment will then be added to the ticket - but won't show in the JiraSpotter side panel unless we can figure out a way to do that..

### Element Tagging

Link and highlight specific HTML elements using CSS or XPath selectors in Jira ticket descriptions and comments:

#### CSS Selector Examples:

```
[tag]input[type="email"][/tag] - Links to email input fields
[tag].submit-button[/tag] - Links to elements with class 'submit-button'
[tag]#login-form[/tag] - Links to element with ID 'login-form'
[tag]button.primary:first-child[/tag] - Links to first primary button
```

#### XPath Selector Examples:

```
[tag]//button[contains(text(), 'Submit')][/tag] - Links to button containing 'Submit'
[tag]//div[@class='container']//input[/tag] - Links to inputs within container class
[tag]//form[1]/div[2]/input[/tag] - Links to specific input using path
[tag]//*[@data-testid='login-button'][/tag] - Links to element by test ID
```

When you click these tags in the Jira ticket:

1. The matching element(s) on the page will be highlighted

### User Mentions

Reference team members in ticket descriptions and comments:

```
@john.doe Could you please review this implementation?
@jane.smith This relates to your previous work on...
```

### Test Recording

Jira Spotter includes a built-in test recorder that generates Playwright tests:

1. Click the "Start Recording" button in the side panel
2. Perform your actions on the page
3. Click "Stop Recording" to generate a Playwright test script
4. The test script will be automatically added to the comment field

### Screenshot Integration

To capture and attach screenshots to Jira tickets:

1. Navigate to the relevant section of your page
2. Click the "Capture Screenshot" button in the side panel
3. The screenshot will be automatically attached to the comment field

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a Jira OAuth App:

   - Go to https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/
   - Create a new OAuth 2.0 app
   - After creating the app, launch JiraSpotter in Chrome
   - Check the browser console for the Redirect URI
   - Add this Redirect URI to your Jira OAuth App settings
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Add your Jira OAuth credentials to `.env`:

   ```
   JIRA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Build the configuration:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Building for Production

When building for production distribution:

1. Ensure your `.env` file contains the production credentials
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. The build process will generate `config.js` with the proper credentials
4. Package your extension as normal

Note: The `config.js` file is gitignored to prevent accidentally committing credentials. Always use the build process to generate it.

### Running Tests

Jira Spotter uses Playwright for automated testing:

1. Install Playwright:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. To run recorded tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:recorded
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Jira tickets not appearing**: Ensure `jira-taskid` attributes or comments are correctly added and match existing Jira ticket IDs.
- **Authentication issues**: Double-check your credentials and try re-authenticating.
- **Screenshot capture fails**: Ensure the page has fully loaded before attempting to capture.
- **Test recording issues**: Check that the page is accessible and interactive before recording.
- **Element tags not highlighting**: Verify that the CSS or XPath selector in the [tag] syntax is valid and matches elements on the page.
- **User mentions not resolving**: Ensure the mentioned users exist in your Jira instance and have access to the project.
- **Other problems**: Contact us at joe@jjs.digital.
